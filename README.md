For the next month you will be working individually or in pairs on an independent
project. The written report from your project is due (as an RMarkdown document
knitted to a PDF file) on Thursday March 12 and you will give a presentation in 
the lab session on Monday March 16.

You will find detailed instructions for the project in the document
[lab-06-instructions](lab-06-instructions.md).

There are also instructions for managing citations, bibliographies, and related
things in the document [citations_bibliographies](citations_bibliographies.md).

Both of these documents are also available on the class web site and the 
RMarkdown source code for them is available on GitHub at
